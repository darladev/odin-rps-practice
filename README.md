# odin-rps-practice: PLAN
Based off of: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

0. Make a git repo for this
1. Start with blank HTML doc with script tag
2. Make a "computerPlay" function that randomly returns "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"
3. Make a function that plays a single round of RPS: takes two parameters: "playerSelection", and "computerSelection". Returns the winner of the round, like this: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
4. Make a function called "game()". Call the "playRound" function *inside* of it, to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
5. Use "console.log()" to display the results of each round and the winner at the end
6. Use "prompt()" to get input from the user
7. Create more helper functions if they could be useful
